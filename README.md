<h3>
A 3D Puzzle, Horror game where players have to solve a 3D generated maze within a limited time. Here every time a player starts a game a random maze is generated using Randomized Depth First Search along with some bias and seed value. There are some enemies randomly spawned in the maze, at first they look like normal grass but if the player makes any noise or turns the torch on then they will wake up and will chase the player and kill him. These AI Enemies are programmed with A*(A-star) pathfinding algorithm. Animation of Enemy is also done from scratch using C++.
